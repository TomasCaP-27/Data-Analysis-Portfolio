# Raw Data – Not Included

The original raw data used in this project is not stored in this repository.

## Reason
The analysis is based on Divvy Bikes public trip data for the year 2024, which consists of
monthly files totaling more than 5 million records.

Due to the size of the dataset, the raw files were:
- Consolidated using SQL in an external environment
- Not uploaded to GitHub to avoid repository size limitations

## Data Availability
The processed and consolidated dataset used for this analysis is hosted on Kaggle and can be accessed there.

Please refer to the main project README for instructions on how to obtain the dataset
and reproduce the analysis.

## Notes
This structure follows common data analysis best practices, where raw data is referenced
but not version-controlled when it exceeds practical size limits.
