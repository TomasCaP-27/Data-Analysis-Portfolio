# Raw Data

This folder is intended to store raw, unprocessed data used as input for the analysis.

Due to licensing restrictions, raw match and player-level data obtained from external sources (e.g. FBref) is **not redistributed** in this repository.

## Notes

- Raw data remains unchanged and is used only as a reference during the data preparation process.
- All analysis in this project is based on **processed and aggregated datasets**, which are available in the `data/processed/` folder.
- This approach ensures compliance with data usage and redistribution policies.
